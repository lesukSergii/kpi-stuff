# Laboratory Work â„–4 on AK-2 KPI Koval Rostislav IO-71

Created a very small project with four source files: one header file and three
source files.
Created a `Makefile` with a `clean` section and `CMakeLists.txt` to build
the project.
Generated from the `CMakeLists.txt` file a build script for `Ninja` build system.

Used commands: 

- Make:
```shell
make -f MakeFileLab4
```
- CMake
```shell
cmake
```
- Cmake with Ninja
```shell
cmake -GNinja
```
